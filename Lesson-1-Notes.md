* Functional form of the model is architecture.
* measure of performance is called loss
* result of the model are called predictions

### Limitations

* a model cannot be created without data
* a model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it;
* This learning approach only creates predictions, not recommended actions;


### Augmenteation

Data augmentation refers to creating random variations of our input data, such that they appear different, but do not actually change the meaning of the data
